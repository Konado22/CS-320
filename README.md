# CS-320
Deliverables from CS-320 final. This project included utilizing junit testing to test codebase and coverage as per assignment requirements.

## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Various methods of testing is the best way to provide as much certainty as possible that code is functional and secure. J unit testing is a great asset we learned about via this course as it can run modular testing and return values to support our claims in the functionality of the codebase. The coverage results that j unit tests provide allows us to see exactly what percentage and lines of code were ran when executing the testing. This can provide us assurance that the codebase it is entirety is testing and support our claims.


## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs or requirements are essential is development and must be taken into consideration prior, during, and after development. Designing classes for required objects needs to contain these requirements in order to be funcitonal. When looking at interperting needs, we need to consider any functional requirements that are deemed neccessary for the project. These are some of the important items that j unit testing can help prove and provide
